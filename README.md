# java-oop-learning
Learning and practicing Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java with examples and mini-projects.

This repository documents my journey of learning **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java**.
It contains concept-wise practice programs as well as mini-projects that apply OOP principles in real-world scenarios.

## What This Repository Contains

### 1. OOP Practice Codes
Concept-wise Java programs created while learning OOP fundamentals.

Topics covered:
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors and `this` keyword
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Abstraction (Abstract Classes & Interfaces)

Each concept is organized into separate folders for easy revision.

### 2. OOP Mini Projects
Small Java projects built to apply OOP concepts practically.

Each project has its own folder and README explaining the design and features.

## Tech Stack
- Java
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Git & GitHub

## Goal
To build a strong foundation in Object-Oriented Programming and develop clean, readable, and well-structured Java code.

This repository will be continuously updated as I learn more concepts and build advanced projects.
